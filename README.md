# Carbon-Emission-Project
This project focuses on predicting CO₂ emissions using key parameters such as country, population metrics, economic indicators, land use, and energy consumption. The objective is to clean and explore the data, then apply a robust machine learning algorithm to accurately forecast future greenhouse gas emissions, with a primary focus on CO₂.
